## Basic Skills

* FAA
  
  Available as PDFs from the FAA or as ebooks from retailers.
  
  * [Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/).
  "This handbook introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will
  be needed as they progress in their pilot training" (preface)
  * [Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/) "This handbook introduces basic pilot skills and
  knowledge that are essential for piloting airplanes. It provides information
  on transition to other airplanes and the operation of various airplane
  systems."

    Some overlap with the PHAK, but has more detail about specific maneuvers.

## Navigation/Charts

* [Chart User's Guide](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/)
  explains how to read various charts.
* [vfrmap.com](http://vfrmap.com) has online scrollable VFR sectional maps, with
  cross references to airport diagrams, etc.
  * The FAA publishes [charts with just the Class B airspace boundaries](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr_class_b/) around
  airports, since sectionals are pretty cluttered.

## Aircraft & Equipment

* [Best Practices to Fly Bonanza G36](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/how-to-best-practices-to-fly-bonanza-g36/167175).
  It's on a MSFS forum, but the information seems generally applicable across
  sims if they support this aircraft.
