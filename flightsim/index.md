## Basic Skills

* FAA
  
  Available as PDFs from the FAA or as ebooks from retailers.
  
  * [Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/).

    "This handbook introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that
    will be needed as they progress in their pilot training."
  
  * [Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/)
  
    "This handbook introduces basic pilot skills and knowledge that are
    essential for piloting airplanes. It provides information on transition to
    other airplanes and the operation of various airplane systems."

    Some overlap with the PHAK, but has more detail about specific maneuvers.

## Navigation/Charts

* [Chart User's Guide](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/)
  explains how to read various charts.
* [vfrmap.com](http://vfrmap.com) has online scrollable VFR sectional maps, with
  cross references to airport diagrams, etc.
  * The FAA publishes [charts with just the Class B airspace boundaries](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/vfr_class_b/) around
  airports, since sectionals are pretty cluttered.

## Aircraft & Equipment

* [Best Practices to Fly Bonanza G36](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/how-to-best-practices-to-fly-bonanza-g36/167175).
  It's on a MSFS forum, but the information seems generally applicable across
  sims if they support this aircraft.
